<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cetirizine hydrochloride is a second-generation antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. It works by blocking histamine receptors, reducing allergic reactions caused by pollen, dust, pet dander, and other allergens. Unlike first-generation antihistamines, cetirizine causes minimal drowsiness, making it a preferred choice for daily allergy relief. It is available in various forms, including tablets, syrups, and chewable tablets. Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, and headache.</span></p>
